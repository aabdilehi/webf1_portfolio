    <p>The discovery log is a document containing details of anything we have learnt throughout this unit. It seems that for this to cover the entire screen it needs to take up at least 1 whole line.</p>

    <h3>Week 1:</h3>
    <p class="para">The first thing we did was set-up the VM and connect to it. Once we were connected, we had to change the password from the one listed on the website. This took many attempts so I asked for assistance. I do not know what the issue
      was but it
      worked in the end.</p>

    <p class="para">Later in the session we were introduced to the different editors that can be used to write code, particularly HTML. I had already been introduced to this concept in A-Levels but there were some useful editors I had not heard of
      such as Atom
      with its auto-fill feature.</p>

    <h3>Week 2:</h3>
    <p class="para">We got into groups and did a worksheet about what kind of information we give out on a daily basis and sorted it into groups such as “sensitive”, “public”, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 3:</h3>
    <p class="para"> We were introduced to the coursework. In this session and the lecture we were taught a method for writing a literature review, specifically the researching part. I started searching for papers on sites like “Google Scholar” or
      some of the
      academic paper libraries that the university has access to such as “IEEE Xplore”. The searches we made were meant to be recorded but I forgot.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 4:</h3>
    <p class="para">
      This week we focused more on how to write a literature review in terms of format, phrasing, etc. We were also taught to be formal, objective and avoid using subjects in your writing (I, you, we, etc.).
    </p>
    <h3>Week 5:</h3>
    <p class="para">
      In this session, we started working on HTML. We created a HTML document and made a really basic web page containing a title (the text on tabs in web browsers), a h1 tag (heading) and a p tag (paragraph). We then uploaded the file to the VMs we
      set up in week 1. This process has quite a few steps.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch the VM</li>
      <li>Launch WinSCP using AppsAnywhere</li>
      <li>Copy the VM’s IP address into WinSCP along with your username and password</li>
      <li>Save this to a folder</li>
      <li>Press Login in WinSCP</li>
      <li>Upload the folder that contains your website to WinSCP</li>
      <li>Launch SSH</li>
      <li>Login to SSH</li>
      <li>Type "cd [folder name]>"</li>
      <li>Type ‘http-server’</li>
      <li>In a new tab, type the VM’s IP address into the search bar</li>
    </ul>
