    <h2>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
       <p class = "para">
        This literature review is about the threats to an individual’s data and how they can be
        minimised. There will be three themes discussed: phishing and how much of a threat it still
        poses; account security and how it can be improved upon; and finally, the GDPR and how
        effective it is in preventing companies from mishandling your data.
      </p>
      <h3>Phishing</h3>
       <p class = "para">
        Phishing is, as defined by TechTerms, <cite>“a con game that scammers use to collect personal
        information from unsuspecting users” (Christensson, P., 2006)</cite>. Phishing can be email-towebsite, website-to-email or website-to-website. As phishing has been around for decades,
        web browsers have had anti-phishing measures built in to alert the user of any suspicious
        happenings but according to ‘Why Phishing Works’, these are not enough to stop users from
        clicking through <cite>(Dhamija, Tygar, & Hearst, 2006)</cite>. Despite the browsers warning, Dhamija,
        Tygar & Hearst found that “23% of participants… did not look at the address bar, status bar,
        or the security indicators.”
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The reliability of the data is hard to judge as the study had a sample size of 22 people and
        most of their data is from 1999-2005. This is an issue as the data may not be an accurate
        representation anymore. One reason they state for why these attacks work is a lack of
        knowledge. In the last 12 years, the percentage of those who have become aware of these
        scams would have increased as the internet becomes more deeply integrated into our
        society. Despite that, the numbers won’t necessarily have decreased. This is due to the
        number of internet users increasing, especially with the advent of smartphone and laptop
        technology. Anti-phishing tools include Phish Tank which is “a user community based antiphishing site” <cite>(Aravindhan, Shanmugalakshmi, Ramya, & C., 2016)</cite>. This is a site which
        consist of websites that have been reported for phishing. Web browsers, or anti-phishing
        browser add-ons, can use this website as a database of websites to avoid. This source does
        a good job of cataloguing the different technologies that have been developed and put into
        use to defend against scammers. It goes into detail and includes diagrams. The data used is
        also a lot more recent than “Why Phishing Works”.
      </p>
      <h3>Password strength</h3>
       <p class = "para">
        While there may be ways to reduce the risk of outside attacks on individuals, there is only so
        much that can be done without the compliance of the user. The user should be aware of
        risks and take an active part in keeping their data secure if they wish to be safe online.
      </p>
      <p class = "para">
        Security is often neglected in areas such as setting passwords for online profiles. When
        choosing a password, users are usually urged to create a strong password that follows a set
        of rules. According to Shahid’s and Qadeer’s study:
      “When choosing a password, it [sic] really should:</p>
<ul  class = "para">
        <li> Not contain words found in a dictionary...</li>
      <li>Not be a name of a friend, relative film stars or even a person in a book.</li>
    <li> Not be less than 8 characters in length</li>
  <li> Not be a number.</li>
<li> Not contain a space”</li></ul>

<p class = "para">
        This was a quote in their study taken off a page from the University of Kent’s website and
        refers to how passwords should be chosen. The quote was referring to users of Windows
        2000 which shows how dated the reference is.
        <cite>(“http://wwww.ukc.ac.uk/informationservices/computing/windows200
        0/publicpc/passwords/choose.html”)</cite>. The page they have referenced has even been
        removed from their website which should make the reader question how much of a bearing
        these guidelines still hold on the creation of a password now. However, this only works to
        strengthen their point as they use guidelines from 1991 which is equidistant from the year
        2000 as the year this source was published (2009). The 2 guidelines used are similar, with
        the only innovation being that the 1991 guideline recommends users to use a password that
        is quick to enter. The idea is that a password that is quickly typed in can prevent shouldersurfing <cite>(Shahid, M., Qadeer & Mohammed A., 2009, p.223)</cite>. This implies that the password
        should be easily memorable. However, memorable passwords tend to be easier to guess
        using brute-force methods and the 2000 guideline recognises and rectifies this issue. There
        seems to be a need for a balance between a password being easy to use and hard to crack.
        This balance is described as one of the issues with an alphanumeric password and why we
        should use other means <cite>(Ithnin & Eljetlawi, 2008)</cite>.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        All three studies attempt to highlight the lack of innovation when it comes to authentication
        methods, with passwords and PINs being the most common used. Shahid & Qadeer discuss
        multiple methods of authentication, all of which are followed by a flowchart describing the
        process in an easy-to-digest manner as well as the advantages and drawbacks of each
        method. There is no apparent bias towards any of the methods, but the study does show
        that not all the methods are equal. On the other hand, the study authored by Tari, Ozok &
        Holden focuses on the idea of graphical passwords and how secure it really is compared to
        a regular password. Both sources acknowledge the idea of shoulder-surfing and the risks
        that poses to security. The third source <cite>(Ithnin & Eljetlawi, 2008)</cite> simply compares the
        usability features of graphical and alphanumeric passwords. However, it gives a good
        background on both and justifies itself well.
      </p>

      <h3>GDPR</h3>
       <p class = "para">
        Social networks often allow users to share information about themselves which is then
        stored away. Users expect the data stored by these companies to be safe in their hands.
        However, Facebook had been a part of a scandal in which around 87 million profiles had
        their personal information obtained improperly and sold to Cambridge Analytica without their
        knowledge or consent <cite>(Isaak & Hanna, 2018)</cite>. This was a breach in trust which made many
        users reconsider using the website to broadcast their lives. The source gives a good account
        of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica occurrence, detailing how they obtained the data, how
        it was used and the consequences.</p>
        <p class = "para">
        The EU’s GDPR includes principles to prevent companies from following in Facebook’s
        footsteps. This has caused companies to change their privacy policies to reflect these new
        laws. The GDPR requires companies to report any data breaches themselves and should
        they fail to do so, they can be fined <cite>“up to 10 million euros or 2 per cent of your global
        turnover”(‘What happens if we fail to notify?’)</cite>. This is effective as it shows that mishandling
        personal data, whether by accident or not, is no small issue. A fine that large is a great
        deterrent.
